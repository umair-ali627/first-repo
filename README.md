# Script Name
**Text to Speech Converter using gTTS**

- This script converts text into speech using Googleâ€™s Text-to-Speech (gTTS) API and saves the output as an audio file (e.g., `.mp3` format).
- It allows for customization of language, speech speed, accents, and other pre-processing and tokenizing options.
- Features:
  - Support for multiple languages using IETF language tags.
  - Localized accents via different Google Translate top-level domains (`tld`).
  - Option to slow down speech for easier comprehension.
  - Custom text pre-processing and tokenization options.
  - Timeout control for network requests.
  - Automatic playing of the audio file after saving (optional).

# Description
This script provides a convenient interface for converting text into speech using the `gTTS` library. The text can be read in multiple languages, at different speeds, and with various localized accents. The script also includes advanced options for pre-processing the input text and customizing how it's tokenized before being sent to the gTTS API.

### Key Features:
- **Multilingual Support**: Specify different languages using IETF language tags (`en`, `es`, etc.).
- **Accents**: Use top-level domains (`tld`), such as `com`, `co.uk`, etc., to localize the accent.
- **Custom Speed**: Option to slow down the speech for better understanding.
- **Pre-Processing**: Built-in support for text pre-processing (e.g., removing punctuation).
- **Timeout**: Set timeout limits for the API request.

# Prerequisites
The following libraries are required to run the script:
```bash
pip install gtts
```

Additionally, the script uses built-in libraries like `os`.
